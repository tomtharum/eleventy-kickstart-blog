  Now why is building your own PC is better than buying a prebuilt system? So building your own pc is 
easier to fix and easier to customize and better overall quality. Now building your own pc may need
a lot of research but tody I am going to show you the best pc build but those build will not blow the bank :

 The Best Gaming PC

 -CPU: Intel Core i5-12600k
 -CPU Cooler: Be Quiet! Shadow Rock Slim 2
 -Motherboard: ASUS TUF Gaming Z690-Plus WiFi D4 LGA1700(Intel 12th Gen) ATX gaming motherboard
 -Ram: G.SKILL F4-3600C16D-16GTZR 16 GB
 -Storage: Samsung (MZ-V8V250B/AM) 980 SSD 250GB,Seagate Barracuda Compute 2 TB 3.5" 7200RPM Internal Hard Drive
 -GPU: PowerColor Red Dragon RX 590 8GB
 -Case: MSI MAG Series FORGE 100R
 -PSU: Corsair CV550 550 Watt, 80+ Bronze Certified
 
The AMD version of the build cost less but still has a much more powerful graphics card than the Intel
while sacrificinga bit of storage on the m.2 nvme ssd but it's okay because it's just the boot drive because
the HDD is where you store the games and all the stuff. I would prefer the AMD version because the GPU has 8gb
of VRAM while the GTX 1650 on the Intel version has only 4gb and the AMD version still cost less
than the Intel version without adding all the taxes and shipping price.
 
  The Best Budget Gaming PC
 
  -CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 5600g
  -CPU Cooler: Stock Cooler
  -Motherboard: ASUS Prime B450m-A_II AMD AM4
  -Ram: TEAMGROUP T-Force Vulcan Z DDR4 16GB Kit (2x8GB) 3200MHz
  -Storage: addlink M.2 SSD 256GB S70 Lite Gaming,
  -GPU: PNY Nvidia T600
  -PSU: EVGA 100-N1-0400-L1 , 400 N1, 400W
  -Case: Cooler Master MasterBox Q300L Micro-ATX Tower
  
  This PC is the budget pick for us coming around 800 dollars a bit on the expensive side but it can play
 most games at medium settings at around 60-100 frames. This graphics card may be not meant for gaming 
 this can still game very well and remember this is a RTX card.
