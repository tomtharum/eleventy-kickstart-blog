  My Preference
  
  -CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 5800x
  -CPU Cooler: Noctua NH-D15
  -Motherboard:  GIGABYTE X570 AORUS Elite Wi-Fi
  -Ram: G.Skill Trident Z NEO Series 32GB (2 x 16GB) 288-Pin SDRAM DDR4 4000
  -Storage: Samsung 980 PRO SSD 1TB PCIe 4.0 NVMe Gen 4,Seagate Barracuda Computer 2 TB 3.5" 7200RPM Interanl Hard Drive
  -GPU: MSI Gaming GeForce GTX 1660 Super
  -PSU: be quiet! Straight Power 11 550W, BN617, Fully Modular, 80 Plus Gold
  -Case: NZXT H510 Flow
  
   I prefer this build because for I don't game much and if I ever game I would never play demanding games so I could use the
  intregrated graphics but I think gtx 1660 super is overkill for me because I usually do stuff like researching, online class
  and watching videos. I just put some overkill parts to future-proofing it so I don't need to upgrade it soon because most 
  computers get obsolete in just a few years.
