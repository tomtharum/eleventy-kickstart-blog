  Now why is building your own PC is better than buying a prebuilt system? So building your own pc is 
easier to fix and easier to customize and better overall quality. Now building your own pc may need
a lot of research but tody I am going to show you the best pc build but those build will not blow the bank :
 The best Gaming PC
 
 -CPU: Intel Core i5-12600K
 -CPU Cooler: Be quiet! Pure Rock 2
 -Motherbpoard: ASUS TUF Gaming B660M-PLUS WiFi D4 LGA 1700(Intel 12th Gen) mATX Gaming Motherboard
 -Ram: G.Skill Trident Z RGB 16 GB DDR4 3600-cl18

 Compute 2 TB 3.5" 7200RPM Internal Hard Drive

 -Case: MSI MAG Forge 100M
 -PSU: EVGA 650 Bq, 80+ Bronze 650W, Semi Modular
  
This can play 1080p games at medium settings smoothly and can play some games at high settings while getting a 
solid smooth framerate. You can also upgrade for a more powerful graphics card like a RTX 3080 when gpu prices
drop.

 The Best AMD Gaming PC

 -CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 5600x
 -CPU Cooler: Be Quiet! Shadow Rock Slim 2
 -Motherboard: GIGABYTE B550M DS3H
 -Ram: G.Skill Trident Z RGB 16 GB DDR4 3600-cl18
 -Storage: TEAMGROUP MP33 256GB SLC Cache 3D NAND TLC NVMe 1.3 PCIe Gen3x4 M.2 2280 Internal SSD,
 Seagate Barracuda Compute 2 TB 3.5" 7200RPM Internal Hard Drive
 -GPU: PowerColor Red Dragon RX 590 8GB
 -Case: MSI MAG Forge 100M
 -PSU: Corsair CV550 550 Watt, 80+ Bronze Certified
 
The AMD version of the build cost less but still has a much more powerful graphics card than the Intel
while sacrificinga bit of storage on the m.2 nvme ssd but it's okay because it's just the boot drive because
the HDD is where you store the games and all the stuff. I would prefer the AMD version because the GPU has 8gb
of VRAM while the GTX 1650 on the Intel version has only 4gb and the AMD version still cost less
than the Intel version without adding all the taxes and shipping price.
