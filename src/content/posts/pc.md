  Now why is building your own PC is better than buying a prebuilt system? So building your own pc is 
  better than just buying a prebuild system from like Alienware, Asus ROG ? Building your own system may
  easier to fix and customize and better overall quality and sometimes certain prebuilt system often cheap
  out on mostly unoticeable things like wifi card, ssd, ... But building your own PC may need a lot of 
  researching but I am hear to help you with that by this post:

 The Best Gaming PC

 -CPU: Intel Core i5-12600KF
 -CPU Cooler: Be Quiet! Shadow Rock Slim 2
 -Motherboard: ASUS TUF Gaming Z690-Plus WiFi D4 LGA1700(Intel 12th Gen) ATX gaming motherboard
 -Ram: G.SKILL F4-3600C16D-16GTZR 16 GB
 -Storage: Samsung (MZ-V8V250B/AM) 980 SSD 250GB,Seagate Barracuda Compute 2 TB 3.5" 7200RPM Internal Hard Drive
 -GPU: MSI Gaming GeForce RTX 3050 8GB GDRR6
 -Case: MSI MAG Series FORGE 100R
 -PSU: EVGA 700 GD, 80+ GOLD 700W
  
  This PC is well capable of running graphics intensive games like Cyberpunk 2077 at Ultra settings smoothly or 
 Forza Horizon 5 at Medium settings smoothly. This PC is gonna be ultra smooth at almost everything you throw at.
 The processor in this rig is really good for the price and is gonna handle task like browsing...
 
  The Best Budget Gaming PC
 
  -CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 5600
  -CPU Cooler: Stock Cooler
  -Motherboard: ASUS TUF Gaming B450M-PLUS II AMD AM4 (Ryzen 5000, 3rd Gen Ryzen microATX Gaming Motherboard
  -Ram: TEAMGROUP T-Force Vulcan Z DDR4 16GB Kit (2x8GB) 3200MHz
  -Storage: TEAMGROUP MP33 1TB SLC Cache 3D NAND TLC NVMe 1.3 PCIe Gen3x4 M.2 2280 Internal Solid State Drive SSD
  -GPU: MSI Gaming AMD Radeon RX 6600 128-bit 8GB GDDR6
  -PSU: Corsair CV Series, CV550, 550 Watt, 80+ Bronze Certified
  -Case: Thermaltake V200 Tempered Glass RGB Edition 12V MB Sync Capable ATX Mid-Tower Chassis
  
  This PC is the budget pick for us but it can play most games at medium settings at around 60-100 frames.
 This is gonna be a decent PC for general usage. The stock cooler included in the box is fairly decent and 
 can handle a little light overclocking but not recommended. You can get some budget cooler like the Vetroo V5
 because this cpu can really get some good performance if overclocked.
 
  The Best No-GPU PC
  
  -CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 5700g
  -CPU Cooler: beQuiet! BK024 Dark Rock Slim CPU Cooler
  -Motherboard: MSI B550-A PRO ProSeries Motherboard AMD AM4, DDR4
  -Ram: Patriot Viper 4 Blackout Series DDR4 16GB (2 x 8GB) 4400MHz Kit
  -Storage: Samsung (MZ-V8V250B/AM) 980 SSD 250GB,Seagate Barracuda Compute 2 TB 3.5" 7200RPM Internal Hard Drive
  -PSU: Thermaltake SMART 600W ATX 12V V2.3/EPS 12V 80 Plus Certified Active PFC Power Supply
  -Case: Cooler Master MasterBox TD500 Mesh White Airflow ATX Mid-Tower
  
   Due to the current gpu crisis, IGPU are making more sense and some of the best IGPU come from AMD and this build
  is a great alternative to some graphics card. This build is gonna game but don't expect it to game at the highest 
  settings or play demanding games like Cyberpunk 2077, Forza Horizon 5 and other demanding games.
  
  The Best Family PC Build
  
  -CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 5600x
  -CPU Cooler: Stock Cooler
  -Motherboard: ASUS ROG Strix B450-F Gaming II AMD AM4
  -Ram: Corsair Vengeance LPX 8GB (1x8GB) DDR4 3200 (PC4-25600) C16
  -Storage: Kingston 480GB A400 M.2 Internal SSD
  -GPU: Gigabyte Geforce GTX 1050 Ti 4GB GDDR5 128 Bit PCI-E Graphic Card (GV-N105TD5-4GD)
  -PSU: Corsair CV450 
  -Case: Cooler Master MasterBox Q300L Micro-ATX Tower
  
   This PC is great for family use, you can do many task on this computer smoothly like watching movies, researching
  and even play some games that doesn't use much resources.
  
  My Preference
  
  -CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 5800x
  -CPU Cooler: NZXT Kraken Z73
  -Motherboard:  ASUS ROG Crosshair VIII Dark Hero AMD AM4 X570S
  -Ram: G.Skill Trident Z NEO Series 32GB (2 x 16GB) 288-Pin SDRAM DDR4 4000
  -Storage: Samsung 980 PRO SSD 1TB PCIe 4.0 NVMe Gen 4,Seagate Barracuda Computer 2 TB 3.5" 7200RPM Interanl Hard Drive
  -GPU: ASUS ROG Strix NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 OC Edition Gaming Graphics Card
  -PSU: be quiet! Straight Power 11 Platinum 850W, BN643, Fully Modular, Power Supply
  -Case: NZXT H510 Elite
  
   I prefer this build because for I don't game much and if I ever game I would never play demanding games so I could use the
  intregrated graphics but I think gtx 1660 super is overkill for me because I usually do stuff like researching, online class
  and watching videos. I just put some overkill parts to future-proofing it so I don't need to upgrade it soon because most 
  computers get obsolete in just a few years.
