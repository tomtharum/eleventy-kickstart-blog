  Choosing mechanical keyboard may be hard for you but it's Tom back here to help you choose the perfect 
keyboard. We have different catergories such as overall which combines every factor like value, build quality,
customizability, feel and sound. 

The Best Overall Mechanical Keyboard:

   Ducky One 3 Fuji TKL 
   
   Pros                         Cons
 
 - Hotswappable                - made of plastic 
 - Looks amazing 
 - Very good stabalizer
 - Double-shot PBT keycpas
 - Very good value
  
  This keyboard is a solid purchase for the cost with quiet rattly-less stablizers and the the keycaps match 
 the scheme of the keyboar. The doubleshot PBT keycaps are made to last years and years without getting 
 greasy are the legends fading. For this price point you would've expected alluminium chasis but it is made 
 out of plastic.
