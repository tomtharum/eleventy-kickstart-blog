  Choosing mechanical keyboard may be hard for you but it's Tom back here to help you choose the perfect 
keyboard. We have different catergories such as overall which combines every factor like value, build quality,
customizability, feel and sound. 

The Best Overall Mechanical Keyboard:

   Ducky One 3 TKL Fuji
   
   Pros:  
 
 - Hotswappable         
 - Looks amazing 
 - Very good stabalizer
 - Double-shot PBT keycpas
 - Very good value
   
   Con:
   
 - chasis made of plasic entirely
  
  This keyboard is a solid purchase for the cost with quiet rattly-less stablizers and the the keycaps match 
 the scheme of the keyboard. The doubleshot PBT keycaps are made to last years and years without getting 
 greasy are the legends fading. For this price point you would've expected alluminium chasis but it is made 
 out of plastic. 
 
 The Best Gaming Keyboard:
 
   Corsair K100 RGB Optical

   Pros:
    
  - Responisive optical switches
  - A lot of RGB
  - Comfortable detacheable wrist rest
  - Very sturdy alluminium chasis 
  - Double-Shot PBT keycaps
  
   Cons:
  
  - Big size may affect mouse movement
  - Expensive 
  
   If you are looking for aggresive per-key RGB and have the budget to spare then, this is the board you will
  like. It's harder to find a more premium or better option than this, but beware of the huge size and check
  if you have space to spare for both your keyboard and mouse. The optical switches on the board makes it ideal
  for gaming. This keyboard also have some fancy extras like volume scroll wheel, macros,... But this thing feels
  solid and feels as heavy as a brick, also you may also like the plush detacheable wrist rest.
  
 The Best Keyboard For Typing And Programming:
 
    Keychron C1
    
   Pros:
  
 - Smooth feeling switches
 - Very good value
 - Black and white keycaps matches the scheme
 - Very comfortable to type on

  Cons
 
 - ABS plastic 
 - doesn't come with wrist rest 
 
   If you are looking for a keyboard that have no extra bells and whistles that has a nice color scheme to it, and 
  has a nice smooth feeling? Then you should consider this keyboard, it is fairly cheap but still they don't have 
  those rattly keystrokes or unkown chinese switches. This keyboard contains Gateron switches whitch is rated for 
  about 60 milllion keystrokes , Gaterons switches are exellent choise for typist and programmer because of they 
  smoothness with little or no scratchiness at all.
   
 The Best Membrane Keyboard: 
 
    Razer Ornata Chroma Membrane Keyboard
  
   Pros:
   
 - Rated to last 80 million keystrokes
 - Programmable macro keys
 - Amazing RGB
 - Keystrokes feel better than most membrane keyboard
 - Comes with comfortable wrist rest
   
   Cons:
  
 - Expensive
 - Less functionality on Mac
 
   This keyboard is a mecha-membrane keyboard, so some people would not consider this membrane but because it's so good
  I have to put it in this list. This is rated to last as long as most mechanical keyboard. It offers key features for 
  an great gaming experience such as programmable key-press combinations, chroma RGB lighting that syncs with 
  gameplay, and a fully integrated comfortable wrist rest that helps keep off fatigue. Thanks to the mecha-membrane keys,
  The Razer Ornata provids a fixed linear actuation point for reliability and robust anti-ghosting so you don't miss any
  keystroke.
  
 The Best Office Keyboard:
  
    Logitech K780 Multi-Device Wireless Keyboard
  
   Pros:
   
 - Bluetooth or wireless USB reciever
 - Great typing experience
 - Quiet typing 
 - Long battery life 
 - Seamless device switching
 - Has a phone or tablet holder

  Cons:
 
 - No backlit
 - No Caps Lock indicator 

  This keyboard is great for office-work due to its silent and comfortable typing experience. You can even hold a phone or
 tablet on the end of the keyboard. You can connect this keyboard through Bluetooth or a wireless USB reciever and you will 
 almost never need to replace the batteries because of its long battery life. And as the name complies you can switch the
 device seamlessly. But if you work at night or anywhere dark, you are out of luck because this keyboard unfortunately has 
 no backlit and to add more it has no Caps Lock indicator which for me is okay but for some people it is a little anoyying.
 
 The Best Barebones Keyboard
 
   GMMK Pro 75
   
  Pros:
 
- Excellent build quality
- Programmable keys
- Programmable Rotatary Knob
- Super customizable
- Great RGB
- Hotswap
 
  Cons:
 
- Unremarkable ergonomics

 The GMMK Pro 75 is the best barebone keyboard you can get for the price, This board is a brick it has no flex at all and feels 
as solid as a keyboard can get because it is a full thick alluminum chassis and base plate. This keyboard has full-programmable 
keys and the programmable rotatary knob which is a little fancy extra suprise. This board has great per-key RGB. But one thing 
that pull this back is the ergonomics which is not great because of the high profile of the board so you may need to buy a wrist
wrest.
