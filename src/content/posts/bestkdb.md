   Con
   
 - chasis made of plasic entirely
  
  This keyboard is a solid purchase for the cost with quiet rattly-less stablizers and the the keycaps match 
 the scheme of the keyboar. The doubleshot PBT keycaps are made to last years and years without getting 
 greasy are the legends fading. For this price point you would've expected alluminium chasis but it is made 
 out of plastic.

   If you are looking for aggresive per-key RGB and have the budget to spare then, this is the board you will
  like. It's harder to find a more premium or better option than this, but beware of the huge size and check
  if you have space to spare for both your keyboard and mouse. The optical switches on the board makes it ideal
  for gaming. This keyboard also have some fancy extras like volume scroll wheel, macros,... But this thing feels
  solid and feels as heavy as a brick, also you may also like the plush detacheable wrist rest.

  those rattly keystrokes or unkown chinese switches. This keyboard contains Gateron switches whitch is rated for 
  about 60 milllion keystrokes , Gaterons switches are exellent choise for typist and programmer because of they 
  smoothness with little or no scratchiness at all.
