excerpt: AMD' new cpu really that good?

---

  AMD just announced about their a new cpu with a new architecture really that good (AKA the Ryzen 7 5800x3D), well 
 according to AMD their new 3D V-cashe design would boost gaming performance by 15 percent. According to Geekbench 
 leaks in single-core and multi-core the Ryzen 7 5800x3D had lower single-core score than the non 3D version the
 Ryzen 7 5800X and a 9 percent improvement in the multi-core score but that was because it has a lower clock count
 than the 5800X. But during recent benchmark in gaming it beats Intel's flagship cpu I9-12600KS by 15 percent in 
 gaming. And that is really impressing because the 12600KS is a 700 dollar cpu while the 5800X3D is only 400 dollars.
