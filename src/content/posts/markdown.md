    Hello I am Tom. I'm interested in computer science and history. I like looking at computer hardware both new and 
    old, there's a old Dell Optiplex 360 system in my house and also a old Thinkpad T61 (which is burned out) which I
    took apart and took the ram, cpu, hard drive and dvd but there's still the nvidia gpu to take out. I also like 
    historyas I mentioned earlier, especially the first and second world war
   
    I live in Phnom Penh, Cambodia and I use a Raspberry Pi 4 as a computer to research but I prefer to use a laptop 
    because they are more portable, but I don't own a laptop but I use my dad's 2015 Macbook Pro sometimes when I 
    cannot use the Pi.
