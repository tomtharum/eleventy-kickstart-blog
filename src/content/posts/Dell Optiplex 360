   If you read the about page, you would know that I have a Dell Optiplex 360 from 2004 in my house. But I don't know
if it still work but I will try connect 
to power. But I checked out the component to make sure that they are in okay condition and also looked at the spec.
   
List of spec :
Ram: Nanya DDR2 2 gigs
CPU: Intel Pentium E5200 Dual-Core 2.50 gigahertz
Motherboard: 360 775, made by Intel
Power Supply: 255 watt
Storage: Seagate Barracuda 7200.10 SATA HDD 250 gigs

   There are some parts that are upgradable that I would like to upgrade such as ram, storage and defenitely put some 
thermal paste on the cpu. I would want
to use it as a Linux machine because Linux is better than Windows in many forms which is so much so I will be 
comparing them in another post. But anyways I don't need to spend a fortune on a brand new pc because this is gonna
is like brand new. But I need to check if it is still working.
