    Hello, it's Tom back here I am going to be talking about the amazing SBC (single-board-computer) Raspberry Pi.
 Raspberry Pi is a very cool and cheap peice of tech that you can do so many things with it such as, making a 
 robot, personal computer, emulate some retro games and can even be used to make a super secure wifi router. But 
 first, I must tell you the story of the epic history of it, that began with a man named, Eben Upton, who is a 
 British engineer, and who would later create the Raspberry Pi and the Raspberry Pi Foundation. He worked
 five years from 2006 to 2011 on a single board computer project (mainly on evening and weekends, while working
 at Broadcom). The BBC Micro from Acorn computers he used at school inspired him to create his own product it was 
 a bit expensive for schools to buy enough computer for all students.On his side, Eben Upton was working on a 
 smaller and cheaper device. First, he worked on big boards to make tests and debug easier, but the goal was to
 create a small computer in the end. When he was working on hsi prototypes he realized something, high computer
 prices in the UK. That means young students didnâ€™t learn computer sciences and turned away from the computer 
 professions. Companies in the UK also lacked computer professionals. 2006 was the beginning of the Internet 
 that we know today:
 - Google was starting to be widely used 
 - Facebook just became accesible for everyone
 - Twitter had it's first tweet
 So, the world needed many programmers and network engineers to continue developing the Internet.
 Eben Upton tried to find a solution, with the goal of building a computer ten times cheaper than the BBC Micro.
 So was born the Raspberry Pi 1A launched in 2012. So let's get into the system The Pi is a ARM SBC which means 
 that the processor is ARM, there is currently no official Windows support for ARM, but you can still use Linux 
 distro such as the official Raspberry pi os,Ubuntu, Manjaro, and many more or you can learn to compile your own
 distro and there are a lot of pros of using Linux over Windows. There are different generation and model of the
 Pi like:
 -Pi 1 Model A (2013)
 -Pi 1 Model B+ (2014)
 -Pi 1 Model A+ (2014)
 -Pi 2 Model B (2015)
 -Pi Zero (2015)
 -Pi 3 Model B (2016)
 -Pi Zero W (2017)
 -Pi 3 Model B+ (2018)
 -Pi 3 Model A+ (2019)
 -Pi 4 Model A (2019)
 -Pi 4 Model B (2020)
 -Pi 400 (2021)
 Another cool thing about the Pi is that they have GPIO pins which you can plug appliances and tinker with them 
 . You can also use them for power to things, I mainly use it for powering the fan to cool my Pi. The new Pi 400 is
 very different from other Pi as it is a computer in a keyboard and it is no thicker than the official Pi keyboard.
