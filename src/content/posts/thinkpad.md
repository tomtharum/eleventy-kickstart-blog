  I metioned in my about page that I had a old Thinkpad T61 which I took apart because the motherboard was burned out.
It had a Nvidia gpu which looks a bit black, which is probably why it burned out. I really like the Thinpad's 
keyboard which has some tactile feedback which I really like, I plan on turning it to a bluetooth keyboard. 
I am surprised of how many ports there are and how solid it is.
List of Specs:
 - 2 gigabyte of DDR2 677MHz RAM
 - 2.4GHz Intel Core 2 Duo T7700
 - 160 WD SATA HDD 7200rpm
 - 256MB Nvidia Quadro FX 570M
I personnaly think this laptop is cool and possibly has a better keyboard than the more modern Thinkpads and other laptop.
