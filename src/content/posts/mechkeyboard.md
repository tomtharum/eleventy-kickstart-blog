excerpt: Why is mechanical keyboard better?...

    Hi, it's Tom back here again, and this time I am gonna be explaining why mechanical keyboard is better
 than the normal keyboard. Now mechanical keyboard refers to the mechanism so mechaincal keyboard has an 
 indivual spring and switch while the normal keyboard membrane keyboard have rubber domes instead of switches
 so both of these types of keyboard has it's own pros and cons like membrane keyboard are affordable while 
 mechanical keyboard are more expensive but moreover the feels are the main difference like membrane keyboard
 have a distinct "mushy" felling upon each keystroke due to the rubber underneath them meanwhile, mechanical 
 keyboards feature spring-loaded switches under the keycaps that actuate smoothly when you press them, responding 
 with an audible "click" sound. Mechanical keyboards give better overall feedback to the user than membrane 
 ones do when typing because of this design. Another thing that often separates membrane and mechanical boards 
 is the presence of key rollover. This feature allows your keyboard to successfully detect several different 
 key presses at the same time, which is invaluable while playing games that feature input combos (for example,
 crouch jumping). It's also helpful if you're a rapid typist. Without key rollover, keyboards will lag behind
 your inputs due to their limited processing. Mechanical keyboards always have key rollover, but membrane keyboards 
 almost always lack full key rollover. Also mechanical switches have different types that have different feels like 
 tactile, linear and clicky. Tactile switches are a type of switch that focus on producing a tactile bump and a 
 relatively quiet audible click with each keystroke. Tactile switches offer great feedback when typing, so you know 
 by the sound and feel everything is working properly and all of your keystrokes are getting logged. Not to mention 
 they are satisfying and fun to use, so most beginners use tactile. Linear are smooth so most gamers use them to get
 a slight advantage over their opponent. Clickies are tactile but louder, they produce a loud distinctive "click" on 
 each keystroke. Also another things seperating membrane and mechanical keyboard is the keycaps like if you want
 to change the keycaps on a membrane keyboard it is hard to find the correct size and shape because they have no standard
 shape or size, on the otherside, mechanical keyboard have a standard shape to fit into the switch.
